# Reflection

## Interesting Things
1. I find it interesting that a Slack app designed to help one workplace could be distributed as a product also to other work places.
2. I like how Slack provides customizable Modals, which can be displayed on the user's screen to collect information.
3. It's easy to listen to events and respond to them with the Events API. 

## Difficult Things
1. I don't understand the purposes of App Home.
2. I have never used a protocol like OAuth before. How would I update the permission scope if the app requires new permissions? 
3. How do I host my app? Through ngrok?

## App ideas
1. Says hi to new users joining #general channel.
2. Remind users about daily standup.
3. Give info for an git repo when the user asks (active PR's, issues, branches)
